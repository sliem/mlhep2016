    "# Build a model to separate decays\n",
    "With the tools we've learned it's possible to build a multivariate statistical model for the Kaggle challenge.\n",
    "1. Separate the dataset into a training and test parts. I suggest using public_train_100000.root , but you are free to experiment.\n",
    "2. Fit separate kernel density estimators for signal and background events on the training part. It has quite a few dimensions - you probably should try to find some good combination of features. I suggest you try something from this list: [u'm_jj', u'm_bb', u'm_wbb', u'm_jlv'] (they were obtained using feature importance of random forest)\n",
    "3. For each element in the test set calculate the signal and background probabilitis - use them to get a score whether the event is signal.\n",
    "4. Compute ROC AUC evaluation of your prediction. I suggest using sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score\n",
    "5. BONUS. Make your model sklearn-compatible. It should be a class inherited from sklearn.base.BaseEstimator and provide .fit and .predict_proba methods."
